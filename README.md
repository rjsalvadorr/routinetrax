# routinetrax

## what is routinetrax?

routinetrax is a monthly routine tracking system, using sheets that track up to 9 routines over the course of a month. It features a tracking grid, which shows patterns that are easy to notice and reason about. It's like looking at a month's worth of journal entries, but condensed into a grid on a single sheet of paper.

Consider this example:

![routinetrax sheet example](doc/example.jpg "routinetrax sheet example")

Looking at the tracking grid, we can compare activity over time periods. The 4th and 5th look like a lot more productive than the 8th and 9th. Maybe this person was just chillin' in the weekend.

We can also look at how consistency across routines. Here, we can see this person was consistently cleaning throughout the month. Their music practice is happening sporadically, but it still happens. However, it'll take more effort to overcome their love of arguing with online trolls.

## who is this for?

If you can describe yourself as "obsessive", "A-type", or a "self-improvement fanatic", you might find this useful. Or if you want to get some of the benefits of a journal, but focused entirely on the actions you take.
