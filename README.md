# routinetrax

## what is routinetrax?

routinetrax is a monthly routine tracking system, using sheets that track up to 9 routines over the course of a month. It features a tracking grid, which shows patterns that are easy to notice and reason about. It's like looking at a month's worth of journal entries, but condensed into a grid on a single sheet of paper.

## who is this for?

If you can describe yourself as "obsessive", "A-type", or a "self-improvement fanatic", you might find this useful. Or if you want to get some of the benefits of a journal, but focused entirely on the actions you take.
