# routinetrax

## what is routinetrax?

routinetrax is a monthly routine tracking system. It lets users track several routines over the course of a month through printed sheets. The sheets feature a tracking grid, which shows patterns that are easy to notice and reason about.

TL;DR --- This system fits a month's worth of journal entries into one sheet of paper, and gives insight into a person's routines over time.

## who is this for?

If you can describe yourself as "obsessive", "A-type", or a "self-improvement fanatic", you might find this useful. Or if you want to get the benefits of a journal, but focused entirely on the actions you take.

## example

Here's a sheet. This person's two weeks into the month, and that's enough to notice some trends.

Looking at the tracking grid, we can compare activity over time periods. The 4th and 5th appear more productive than the 8th and 9th. This person was probably just chillin' during the weekend.

We can also look at consistency across routines. Here, we can see this person was consistently cleaning over the last two weeks. Their music practice is happening sporadically, but it still happens. But it'll take more effort to overcome their love of arguing with online trolls.
