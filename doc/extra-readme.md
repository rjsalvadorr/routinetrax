## why was this created?

> “If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.”

When the COVID-19 lockdown upended my life and work habits, I found myself really disoriented and disorganized. I was very fortunate not to lose my job, but the WFH lockdown life still presented challenges. The days blurred together, time lost its meaning, then my well-being and productivity took a nosedive. I decided to correct this course by rebuilding my habits. The idea was to ditch the habits that don't work (like doomscrolling and endless introspection), and replace them with helpful ones (like meditation and exercise)

This "routinetrax" system was made to track my progress and keep my routines moving in the right direction.

## why 9?

I found it easy to memorize the 9 habits after a week, and it forced me to prioritize the routines I'm working on.

## why paper?

I'm primarily interested in routines that take place in the real world, and paper exists IRL. In addition, I feel it's got some more advantages:

+ paper cannot be turned off, and may be harder to ignore when it's visible (my tracking sheet is always on my desk or music stand)
+ the tactile feeling of marking marking something "done" might reinforce the feeling of accomplishment
+ we have enough f***ing digital screens to deal with in 2020. Do you really want more of that? Because I don't. As a software dev that stares at screens for 8 hours every workday (plus several more hours for fun), I want to give my eyes a rest. So I chose to do all this stuff on dead trees.
